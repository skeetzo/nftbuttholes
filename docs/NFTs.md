# NFTs

Explain:
1) what is an NFT?
2) what is jpeg NFT useful for?
3) why butthole NFTs?
4) how do I "mint" a butthole NFT?
5) how do I upload my butthole?
6) how do I trade my butthole jpeg(s)?

## 1

NFT stands for "Non-Fungible Token". A non-fungible token is a representation of a unique "thing". Many things are or can be represented by non-fungible tokens.

## 2

A jpeg NFT is useful for representing that someone owns a particular "thing". That "thing" may or may not be the jpeg itself or, so to speak, a representation of access that is symbolized by the jpeg photo. For example, to get into an exclusive club, one might require to flash their exclusive "access card" or know the password, etc. An NFT, being unique, can represent "ownership" of anything when it is properly represented digitally.

This stupid fucking project that caught my attention chose to use, for lack of a whole long tldr, the scammiest laziest option to chase greed. Which I am not okay with. They could have literally just done "the easy thing" or "the right thing" that ensures the least amount of potential for unintentional collateral damage. Which they have not done. So here we are, with this project here. Butthole nfts.

To mint an NFT you can load the contract in a site that parses it for access, such as etherscan. Here is a link to do so: [link](). The "contract" tab allows you to interact with the "smart contract" that handles all of the NFT logic. To mint an NFT, call the "mint()" function and click through the necessary confirmation dialogues in whichever web browser wallet you are using to send a tx directly to the contract. This will mint you an NFT.

If you are a whitelisted member of the "butthole community", ala, a "professional" performer who can be verified then you can reach out to me, the "developer", here: WebmasterSkeetzo@gmail.com

Once you have been whitelisted, you may upload a butthole NFT by interacting with the contract via the abovementioned fashion. Instead, select the "addButthole()" function and include the hash of your butthole image on IPFS. Or, if creating an IPFS hash is outside of your purview, I will gladly be able to do this step for you once you have been whitelisted.

Anyhow you figure out. There are no restrictions.

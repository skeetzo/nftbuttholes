# NFTs

Explain:
1) what is an NFT?
2) what is jpeg NFT useful for?
3) why butthole NFTs?
4) how do I "mint" a butthole NFT?
5) how do I upload my butthole?
6) can I trade my butthole jpeg(s)?
7) how do the royalties work?

## 1

NFT stands for "Non-Fungible Token". A non-fungible token is a representation of a unique "thing". Many things can be represented by a non-fungible token, such as a picture of a butthole.

## 2

A jpeg NFT is useful for representing that someone owns a particular image. Why? Because they're weird.

This other stupid fucking project that caught my attention turned out (to me) to be an outright scam. Which I am not okay with. They could have literally just done "the easy thing" or "the right thing" from the start (an EVM compatible smart contract) that ensures the least amount of potential for unintentional collateral damage to the crypto-noobies they have roped into the project. Which they have not done. So here we are, with this project here. Butthole nfts.

To mint an NFT you can load the contract in a site that parses it for access, such as Etherscan. Here is a link to do so: [TBD](). The "contract" tab allows you to interact with the "smart contract" that handles all of the NFT logic. To mint an NFT, first add yourself as a minter by calling the addMinter() function and then call the "mint()" function. Click through the necessary confirmation dialogues in whichever web browser wallet you are using to interactly directly with the contract. This will mint you a butthole NFT.

If wish to be a member of the "butthole community", ala, a "professional" performer who must be verified to be an actual person then you can reach out to me, the developer, at: WebmasterSkeetzo@gmail.com

Once you have been verified, you may upload an image for your butthole NFT by interacting with the contract via the abovementioned fashion. Select the "addButthole()" function and include the hash of your butthole image on IPFS. Or, if creating an IPFS hash is outside of your technical skills, I will gladly be able to do this step for you-- please feel free to ask me any questions via email.

Yeah go wild.

Anytime an NFT is minted or traded, a portion of the ETH spent on the transaction between the buyer & seller is collected as a royalty fee. The royalty fee is 2%-10%. From this base amount, it is further split. Each NFT may be associated with up to 3 "starving artists" or addresses to forward donated amounts to. The royalty amount that is taken on each mint/trade is split between the butthole artist and any associated donation addresses.

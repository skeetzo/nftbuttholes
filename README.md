# NFT Buttholes

"The +1 is the Masterpiece “La Fusion des Anus” that will be sold in auction after the public mint of the other 2000 NFT's. The owner of the masterpiece will get 1 % of the next collections resales for life. Holders will have 15% of its auction sale and 5% for life on every resale."

1% -> "next collections" resale -> owner
15% -> auction -> holders
5% -> resale -> holders

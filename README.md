# NFT Buttholes

This is a recreation project of another project to demonstrate how fucking stupid that other project is and how disappointed I am in all of the models that got involved.

------

### Goal
My own NFT buttholes project that makes their NFT buttholes project look like the stupid and pointless scam that it is (seriously, Solana?? fucking clowns...)

#### Requirements:
General:
- anyone 18+ can participate
- easy to use, not convoluted; no hidden information
- fair
- NFTs (of buttholes)

Operation:
- EVM compatible smart contract
- can be upgraded
- fair distribution
- no batch minting; no cumulative benefits
- QoL scripts

Trading:
- auctionable
- percentage of royalties forwarded to chosen charities / services 
- tradeable

Utility:
- ongoing VIP membership benefits for sites, events
